## WarGames 
#### Individual project from "Programmering 2", a course from my second semester. 

We worked on this project throughout most of the semester. The task was to make an application that simulated a battle between two armies. It was split into 4 parts, where we for the first parts would get requirement specifications about what we should implement, based on what we were learning throughout the course. In the end we were "set free" and told to be creative and implement whatever we felt would improve the application. The requirements were mainly techincal specifications, so we had a lot of freedom for the rest of the application. 

For my part I had an early idea of the aesthetic and workflow of the application and followed my initial plan closely. While we originally only were required to implement the battle-simulation "behind the scenes" and then present the result, I wanted to create a battle simulation with some sort of two-dimensional representation of the battle. My knowledge about multi-threadded programming was definately not good enough, and ended up having the 2D battle drawn on a frame that opened up upon running. Not optimal, but all in all, I am very happy with the outcome of the project (and so was the examiner xD).
